¶ Leernyd men of þe lawe . þat lowde myȝte speke
with sawteers seet hym by . þe salmes to reede
of douȝty dauyd þe kyng . & of his deere storyes
of iosue þe noble iew . & iudas machabeus .

¶ Cayfas out of þe hucche . cawghte vp arolle
& redde how þe childryn of irael . ran thorw þe red se
whan pharao & his fook . in þe flood drenchyd
& meche of moyses lawe . he menyd in þat tyme .

¶ whan þe feyȝtles fook . were to þe feeld come
& þere were enbatayled . with many britħ wepene
with baneers & pensellis . & beestes y-armed
Miȝt non man se þe sunne . ne þe cyte knowe .

¶ waspasyan deuysed þe vale al abowte
with baneers & ouer-spredde to þe town ȝates
to barouns & bolde men þat hym abowte weryn

¶ here ne is kyng ne knyȝt . come to þis place
baroun ne bacheleer . ne man þat me folwith
but þe cause of his comyngge . is crist to auenge
vp-on þese feyȝtlees folk . þat falsly hym slowyn .

¶ Loketh vp to heuyn-ward . þat thenkyth on his woundes
of bynddyng . of betyng . þat he on his body hadde
& lat nat þese helle houndes . leyȝe at his harmes
þat so deere bought vs . with blood of his herte .

¶ And lete hem neuere be no wey . with fyȝt of vs wynne

whil eny lyf may laste . in eny of oure hertis .

¶ For thei are feynt at fyȝt . & fals of byleue
but ȝit þey wene at a weef . al þe wurld to wynne
neyther grounded in god . ne in his grace tristen
but in sternenysse of hem-self . & in her strenghe one .

¶ And we are dyȝt in þis day . ⟦⟧ \crist/ for-to serue

¶ Tru(m)pores tru(m)ped vp-on heygh . & blewyn vp faste

¶ Clarions cryed faste . & coryous pypes
tymbres & tabres . & mynstracye ynowe
whan þis noyse was y-maad . þo tremblyd þe iewes
as wommen wepeth an hey . whan þat sorwe hem neyȝeth .

¶ Thei lawgthen launces anon . & lepyn to-gydres
as fyr owt of flynt-stoon . it feerde hem betwene

¶ Tytus turnyd hym anon . & kylleth of þe beste
for iusteth þe iolyest . with ioynyng of werre
& also with a bryȝt brond betyth on harde
