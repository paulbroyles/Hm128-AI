¶ Thanne made he in þe mydde . of þe town crye
who wulde eny iewes bygge . þat he come anon
& haue for o . peny alone . ȝif he paye wulde
alwey thrytty iewes . ybounde togydre with roopes .

¶ Thus were they bougħt & soold . & brougħt owt of þat londe
& neuer sythen there aȝen . com non of ther kynde
ne noon þat leueth in her lawe . schal in þat londe dwelle
that turnementyd trewe cryst . & so tytus comaundede .

¶ Saue iosephus þe gentyl iew . aiourned was to rome
& of this mateer & mo . there he made bokes .
& pylat was to prison put . to pyne ther for euere
& vyan a vyl deeth . for his synnes suffred .

¶ whanne alle these doomes were y-doon . they drewe vp her tentys .
trussed vp here tresour . & tru(m)pyd vp the seege .
wente synggyng awey . & lefte woo there
And hoolreedyn to rome . ⟦⟧ \y-blessyd/ be god almyȝty .
