that vylienye to venge . but mekeliche it suffrede .

¶ But ay taryed þe tyme . ȝif they amende hem wulde .
& ȝaf hem space of mendement . thow it spedde lytel .
Fourty wynter as y fynde . & neuer a day lasse .
Ar he veniaunce on hem took . for-sothe y ȝow telle

¶ Tyl it tytte on a tyme . oon tytus of rome
that al gasgoyne gat . & gyen the noble .
he was desesed fulsore . in nerois tyme .
with amaledye vn-meke . amyddis his face .

¶ his lippe lay on a lumpe . & cleuyd to his cheke .
as a acanker vn-clene . enclosyd it hadde .
And his fadur waspasian . wurderlyche betydde
A swarm of waspes & of bees . bredde yn his nose .

¶ & were heuyd in his hed . while þat he was ȝong
& waspasian was cald . by-cause of the waspes
ther was non leche on the londe . these lordes cowde hele .
ne gras growyng on ground . that hem helpe myȝte .

¶ Therwas no syknesse so sor . þat eny man suffrid
For on a lepre he lay . ȝit þ(er)to in rome
Of galys he was lord . thowȝ he care hadde

¶ Thanne was þ(er) on nathan naymes sone of grece
that ofte passyd the se . from cyte to other
he knew cuntres manye . & kymdomys bothe
& was amaryneer meche . & marchaunt also

¶ Senstius of surry . sente hym to rome
to nero the empero(ur) . in message of iewys
of his tribuyt to telle . that he hem paye noolde .

¶ This nathan to nero . took þe nexte wey
Ouer þe grykesche se . with the grete wawes
& sone reysed vp þe ceyl . ouer þe salt water
& witħ adromund in depe . dryued on swithe .

¶ The wolkyn wannyd anon . & þe water flowyd
the clowdes alle to-clatred . as they to-cleue wulde
the rakke with þe red wynd . roos in the myddes
& sone sette on þe se in soutħ ende .

¶ It bleew & þe brod se . bolmyd vp harde
nathan þo anon . on þe nortħ dryues
so þe wedur and þe wynd . on þe water metitħ
that al it hurtlyd on hepe . þat the helm kepte .

¶ Nathan for fer tho . flew vnder hacches
& leet þe wynd & þe wawes . wurche as þey wulde .
the schip turned aȝenward . & no-thyng toward rome
vpon costes vnknowe . þanne caryed hem

¶ Ropes ful redyly . thanne rasyd in sondur .

¶ with meche desese at þe last . as owre lord wulde
Al was bore at a breyd . to burdeux hauyn .
