and as naked as anedle · and noon helpe about hym

¶ Feyþ had ferst sygth of hym · ac he fley ⟦ȝe⟧ on syde
and nolde nougth neyhen hym · by nyne londes lengþe

¶ hope cam hyppyng after · that hadde so bostyd
how he wyþ moyses maundement · hadde many men holpe
ac whan he had sygth of þat segge · a-syde he gan hym drawe
dredfully by þis day · as doke doiþ from þe fawcou(n)

¶ Ac so sone as ⟦as⟧ þe samarytan · hadde sygth of þys lede
he lygth a-dou(n)n of lyard · and ladde hym yn his hand
and to þe wye he wente · his woundys to byholde
and p(ar)ceyued by his powse · he was yn p(er)yl to dye
and but ȝif he hadde recouerer þe raþ(er) · þat ryse schulde he neu(er)e
wyþ wyn and wyþ oyle · his woundys he weisch ·
enbawmyd hym and bond his heed · and in his lappe hym leyde ·
and ladde hym so foorþ on lyard · to lex (christi) a graunge
wel sixe myle or seuene · by-syde þe newe markat
herberwyd hym at an hostry · and to þe hostyler called
and seyde haue kepe þis man · tyl y com fro the iustus
and loo here syluer he seyde · for salue to his woundys
and he took hym two pans · to lyflode as yt were
and seyde what he spendeþ more · y make þe good her-after ·

¶ And whan y say þys y soiornyd nougth · but schoop me to renne
and sewyd þat samaritan · þat was so ful of pyte ·
and grauntyd hym to ben his groom · g(ra)untmercy he seyde
