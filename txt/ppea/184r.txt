¶ I had wonder of his woordes · and of his wyde cloþes
for in his bosom he bar a þyng · þat he blessid euere
and y looked yn his lappe · a lazar lay þ(er)ynne
amonges patryarkes and p(ro)phetes · pleyenge to-gydres

¶ What waytest þu q(uod) he · and what woldest þu haue
y wolde w⟦y⟧\e/te q(uod) y þoo · what is yn ȝowr lappe

¶ Loo q(uod) he and le⟦..⟧\et/ me see · lord mercy y seyde
þis ys a p(re)sent of moche prys · what prynce schal it haue

¶ It is a p(re)sent p(re)ciouse q(uod) he · ac þe powke it haþ attached
and me þ(er)wyþ q(uod) þat man · may no weed vs quyte

owt of þe powkes pynfold · no maynprys may vs fecche
tyl he come þat y carpe of · cryst is his name ·

and bettre we⟦..⟧\d/ for vs legge · þan we ben alle wurþy

¶ Alas y seyde þat synne · so longe schal lette
þe myht of goddes mercy · þat mygth vs alle amende
y wepte for his woordys · wyþ þat sawȝ y an nother
rapely renne forþ · þe rygth wey he wente ·
y frayned hym ferst · fro whennys he come
and what he higth and whider he wolde · and wyhtly he tolde

Passus iij(us) · de do-bet ·
[*I*]
I am spes q(uod) he aspye · and spere after a knygth
þat took me a maundement · vpon þe mount synay
to rewle alle rewmys wyþ · y bere þe wryt here
ys it asseled y seyde · may men see thy lettrys
Nay he seyde y seke hym · þat haþ þe seal to kepe
and þat is þe cros and crystendom · and cryst þ(er)onne to honge ·
and whan it is asseled so · y wot wel þe soþe
that lucyferes lordschipe · laste schal no lengere

¶ Lat see þy lettres q(uod) y · we mygth þe lawe knowe
thanne plucked he forþ a patent · a pece of an hard roche
where-on were wryte two woordes · on þys wyse y-glosed
Dilige deu(m) & p(ro)x(imu)m tuu(m) · & c(etera)

¶ This was þe text trewly · y took ful good ȝeme
the glose was gloryously wryten · wyþ a gylt penne
In hijs duob(us) mandatis · tota lex pendet & p(ro)phecia · & c(etera)

¶ Ben here in þese two alle þe lawes q(uod) y · ȝe leeue me wel he seyde
