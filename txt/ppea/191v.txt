sette hym yn solace · and yn souereyn merþe
and syþþe he suffryd hem synne sorowe to fele
to w⟦y⟧\e/te what wele was · kyndelyche to knowe it
and aftyr god aduenturyd hym-sylf · and took adamys kynde
to w⟦y⟧\e/te what he haþ suffryd · yn þree sundry places
boþe in heuene and yn erþe · and now tyl helle he þynkeþ
to w⟦y⟧\e/te what alle woo is · and what is alle ioyȝe ·

¶ It schal fare by þis folk · her folye and her synne
schal lere hem what lango(ur) is · and lysse wyþ-owtyn ende
woot no wyȝt what werre is · þere that pees regneþ
ne what is wytterly wele · tyl weylowey hym teche ·

¶ Thanne was þ(er)e awygth · wyþ two brode eiȝen
book higth that beaup(er) · a bold man of speche ·
by goddys body quod þys book · y woll bere wytnesse
þat þo this barn was ybore · ther blasyd a sterre ·
þat alle þe wyse of þe world · yn oo wytt accorded
þat such a barn was born · yn bethleem cytee ·
þat mannys sowle schuld saue · and synne destruye
and alle þe elymentys quod þe book · herof bereþ wytnesse
that he was god þat all wrougth · þe welkene ferst schewyd ·
tho that weren yn heuene · token stella cometa
and tendeden hire as a torche · to reu(er)ence his byrþe
the lygth folwyd þe lord · ynto þe lowe erþe ·
that wat(er) wytnessyd þat he was god · for he went on it
pet(er) þe apostle · p(er)ceyuyd his gate ·
and as he went on þe wat(er) · well he hym knew and seyde
Iube me ad te venire sup(er) aquas · & c(etera) ·

¶ And loo how þe sonne gan lowke · hir lygth yn her-sylue
whan sche sawh hym suffre · þat sonne and se made ·
the erþe for heuynesse that he wolde suffre ·
quaked as quyk þyng · and all biquassht þe roche
loo helle ne mygth nougth · holde · but openyd þo god þolede ·
and lat owt symondys sone · to seen hym hange on rode ·
and now schall lucifer leue it · þowh hym loiþ þynke ·
for gigas þe gyaunt · wyþ a synne engyned
to breke and to bete a-dou(n) · that ben aȝenst (ihesus)
and y book woll be brent · but (ihesus) ryse to lyue
yn alle myhtes of man and his moder gladye
and confortyn al his kyn · and owt of care brynge
and alle þe iewen ioyȝe · vnioynen and vnlowke ·
