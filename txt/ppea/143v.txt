Passus octauus de visione · & p(ri)mus de do-weel ·
[*t*]
Thus ro⟦....⟧\bed/ yn russat · y romed aboute
all a somer cesou(n) · forto seke do-wel
And frayned fulofte · of folk⟦e⟧ that y mette
ȝif eny wygth wyste · where do-wel was at ynne
and what man he mygth be of many man y askede

¶ ⟦...?...⟧\was neu(er) wyth as/ y wente · that me wysse cowde
where this lede lenged lasse ne more
tyl it befell on a Fryday · two frerys y mette
maystres of the menours · men of grete wytte
y halzed hem hendely · as y hadde lerned
and prayde hem pur charyte · er they passyd ferther
ȝif þey knewe any cuntre · or cost as they wente
wher þat do-wel dwelleth · dooþ me to wyten
for þey ben men of this molde þat most wyde walkyn
and knowyn contres and courtes · and many kynne places
boþe p(ri)nces palays · and pore mennys cotes ·
and do-wel and do-euyl · where they dwelle bothe

¶ Amonges vs q(uod) the menours · that man is dwellynge ·
and euer haþ as y hope · and euere schall here-aftyr

¶ Contra quod y as a clerk⟦e⟧ · and comsed to despute
and seyde hem soothly · sepcies in die cadit iustus

¶ Seuene sythes quod the book · synnyth the ryghtfull
and who-so synnyth as y seyde · dooþ euyl as me thynketh
and do-wel and do-euele · mowe nougth dwelle togydres
ergo he is nougth alway · amonge ȝow frerys
he is oþerwhile elles-where · to wysse the peple

¶ y schall seye þe my sone · seyde the frere thanne
how seuene sythes þe sadman · on a day synneth
by a forbisene q(uod) the frere · y schall the fayre schewe
lat brynge aman yn a bote · amydde the brod wat(er)
and þe wynde and þe wat(er) · and þe bote waggynge
makeþ þe man many a tyme · to falle and to stonde
for stonde he neu(er)e so styffe · he stomblyth ȝif he meue
and ȝit is saufe and sound · and so hym byhoueth
for ȝif he ne aryse þe rathur · and rauȝt to the sterne ·
the wynde woold wyþ þe wat(er) · the bote ouerþrowe
and þanne were his lyf⟦e⟧ loste · þorough lacches of hym-sylue

¶ And þus it falleth q(uod) þe frere · by folk⟦e⟧ here on erthe
the wat(er) is lyknyd to þe world⟦e⟧ þat wanyeþ and wexeth
