and comen to þe kynges counseyl · as a kene barou(n)
and kneled to conscyence · in court aforen hem alle
and gart good feyþ flee · and fals to abyde ·
and boldlyche bar adou(n) · wyþ manye a brygth noble ·
moche of þe wytt and wysdom · of westmynster halle ·
he iuged to a Iustice · and iusted in his ere ·
and ouertylt al his trewþe · wyþ tak þis vp amendement
and ynto þe arches yn haste · he ȝede anon after ·
and turnyd cyuyle ynto symonye · and siþ took þe official ·
for a mantell of menyuer · he made lele matrymoigne
be dep(ar)tid or deþ cam · and deuors schapte

¶ Alas quod conscyence and cryed þo · wold cryst of his grace ·
that coueytise were crystene · that is so kene a fyhtere ·
and bold and abidynge · while his bagge lasteþ

¶ Thanne lough lyf · and leet dagge his cloþes
and armyd hym yn haste yn harlottes woordys ·
and held holynesse a iape · and hendenesse a wastour
and leet lenten a cherl · and lyȝer a freman ·

¶ Thus relyȝed lyf · for a lytel fortune ·
and pryked foorþ wyþ pryde · p(re)yseþ he no vertu ·
and careþ nougth how kynde slowh · and schall come at þe laste
and kylle alle erþly creatures · saue conscyence one ·

schall do þe nougth drede · neyther deþ ne elde ·
and to forȝete sorowe · and ȝyue nouȝt of synne

¶ This lyked lyf · and his lemman fortune ·
and getyn in her glorye · a gadelyng at þe laste ·
on that moche wo wroughte · slewþe was his name ·
slewþe wax wonder ȝerne · and swyþe was of age
and wedded on wanhope · a wenche of þe stewes
her syre was a sysour · that neuer swoor twrowþe
on thomme two tou(n)ge · a-teynt at eche a queste ·

¶ This slewþe was war of werre · and a slynge made ·
and threw drede of dyspeyr · a dozeyn myle abowte

¶ For care conscyence tho · cryed vppon elde ·
and bad hym fonde to fyghte · and affere wanhope ·

¶ And elde hente goodhope · and hastylyche he schifte hym ·
and weyued awey wanhope · and wyþ lyf he faught
