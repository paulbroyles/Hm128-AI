and myldelyche his mercy axe · mygth y nougth be sauyd 

¶ Thus seyde þe samarytan · so wel thu mygth repente
þat ryȝtwysnesse þurgh repentaunce · to rewþe mygth turne
ac it is but seldom seyn · there soþnesse bereþ wytnesse
eny creature þat is cowpable · afore a kynges iustyse ·
be raunsomed for his repentaunce · þ(er)e al resou(n) hym dampneþ
for þat p(ar)tye purseweþ · the peple is so huge ·
þat þe kynge may do no mercy · tyl boþe men accorde
and eyþer haue equyte · as holy wrytt telleþ
Numq(ua)m dimittitur peccatu(m) · & c(etera)

¶ Thus fareþ it by suche folk · þat falsly all her lyues ·
euyl lyuen and letten nougth · tyl þe lyf hem forsakeþ
good hope that helpe schulde · to wanhope turneþ
nougth of þe nounpower of god · þat he ne is myhtful ·
to amende al þat amys is · and his mercy grettere ·
þa(n) alle our wycked werkes · as holy wryt telleþ
Misericordia eius sup(er) om(n)ia op(er)a eius · & c(etera)

¶ Ac ar his ryȝtwysnesse to rewþe turne · sum restituciou(n) bihoueþ
his sorowe is satisfacciou(n) · for hym þat may nougth paye ·

¶ Thre þynges þ(er) ben · that don a man ⟦aman⟧ by strengþe
forto fleen his owen hous · as holy wrytt scheweþ
þat on is a wycked wyf · þat woll nougth be chastised
her feere flee⟦n⟧\þ/ from here · for fere of her tonge
and ȝif his hous be vnhelyed · and reyne on his bedde
he sekeþ and sekeþ · tyl he slepe · dryȝe
and whan smoke and smolder · smyt yn his sygth\e/
yt doiþ hym wurse þa(n) his wyf · or wete to slepe
for smoke and smother · smyt in his eiȝen ·
tyl he be blereiȝid or blynd · and horce yn þe þrote
cougheþ and rouȝtheþ · and byt cryst ȝyue hem sorowe
þat schuld brynge yn bettre wode · or blowe tyl it brenne ·

¶ these þree þat y telle of · ben thus to vnderstonde
the wyf is our wycked flesch · þat wol nougth be chastysed ·
for kynde cleueþ on hym euere · to contrarye þe sowle
and þowȝ it falle it fynt skylles · þe freelte it made
and þat is lyȝtly forȝyuen · and forȝetyn boþe ·
to man þat mercy askeþ · and amende þenkeþ

¶ The reyn þat reyneþ · there we reste schulde ·
ben syknesses and sorwes · þat we suffryn ofte ·
as poule the apostle · to the peple tauȝte ·
