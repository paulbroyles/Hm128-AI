eche day after oþer · her tyme they awaytede
tyl it befell on a fryday · a lytel byfore pasch
þe þursday byfore · there he made his mawnde
syttyng at þe soper · he seyde these woordes
y am solde þurgh oon of ȝow · he schal þe tyme rewe
þat eu(er)e he his sauyour solde · for syluer or elles

¶ Iudas ianglyd þer-aȝen · ac (ihesus) hym tolde
yt was hym-sylf soþly · and seyde tu dicis

¶ Thanne went foorþ þat wycked man · and wyþ þe iewes mette
and told hem atokne · how to knowe (ihesus)
and whiche tokene to this day · to muchil is vsyd
þat is kyssyng and fayr contynaunce · and vnkynde wylle
and so was wyþ iudas tho · þat (ihesus) bytrayed ·
aue rabi q(uod) þat rybaud · and rygth to hym he ȝede
and kessed hym to be cauȝt þ(er)by · and kyllyd of þe iewes

¶ Thanne (ihesus) to iudas · and to þe iewys seyde
falsnesse y fynde · yn thy fayre speche ·
and gyle in thy glad chere · and galle ys yn þy lauhynge
thu schalt be myrrour · to many men to desceyue

Necesse est vt veniant scandala · ve ho(m)i(ni) illi p(er) que(m) scandalu(m) venit · & c(etera)

¶ Thowh y by tresou(n) be take · at ȝowr owen wylle
suffreþ myne apostles · in pays and in pees gange
vpon a thursday in thesternesse · thus was he taken
thrugh Iudas and iewes · (ihesus) was his name ·
that on þe fryday folwynge · formankyndes sake
iusted in ier(usa)l(e)m · a ioyȝe to vs alle
on cros vpon caluarye · cryst took þe batayle
aȝenst deeþ and þe deuyl · destruyed her boþers myhtes
deyed and deeþ fordede · and day of ⟦....⟧\nyȝt m/ade

¶ And y awakyd þ(er)wyþ · and wypid myn eiȝen ·
and after peris þe plouhman · pryed and stared
estward and westward · y wayted after faste
and ȝede foorþ as an ydyot · yn contre to aspye
after peris þe ploughman · many a place y sougthe
and þanne mette y wyþ aman · amdylent sonynday
als hore as an hawþorn · abrah(a)m he higthe
y frayned hym ferste · fro whennys he come
and of whennys he where · and whider þat he þouhte

¶ I am feyþ q(uod) þat freke · yt falleþ nougth to lyȝe
